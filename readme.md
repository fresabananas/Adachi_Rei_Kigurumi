### Overview

This repository is meant to help document my successes and failures as I attempt to DIY an Adachi Rei animegao mask.

Some features I want to incorporate into the mask:

- LED Grid Eyes, also considering a mouth along the way.
- Ventilation
- Soundboard / Voice Changer
- Rocket Launcher
